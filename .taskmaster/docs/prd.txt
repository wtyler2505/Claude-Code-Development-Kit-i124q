CCDK Enhancement Kits 1-6 Integration Project

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Integrate six progressive enhancement kits into the Claude Code Development Kit (CCDK) to create a comprehensive AI-powered development environment. This integration will enable advanced features including persistent memory, analytics dashboards, automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, and intelligent task management.

BUSINESS OBJECTIVES:
- Create a unified development environment with all enhancement kit features
- Enable persistent memory and context across Claude sessions
- Provide real-time analytics and monitoring capabilities
- Automate development workflows including testing and deployment
- Support team collaboration through automated PR reviews
- Maximize developer productivity with intelligent tooling

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. CORE INFRASTRUCTURE
- Create .claude directory structure for commands, agents, and hooks
- Merge configuration files from all 6 kits without conflicts
- Ensure all hooks are registered exactly once in settings.json
- Support both Windows and Unix-based systems
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing CCDK installations

2. KIT 1 - CORE EXTENSIONS
Features to integrate:
- Security audit command for code vulnerability scanning
- Automated test running with multiple framework support
- Git PR creation with template generation
- Context-specific loaders for frontend development
- Backend architect agent for system design
- Python engineer agent for Python development
- UI designer agent for interface creation
- Security auditor agent for vulnerability assessment
- Session persistence hooks for memory retention
- Task summary generation after completion
- Search operation logging for analytics

3. KIT 2 - DEPENDENCY & PERFORMANCE
Features to integrate:
- Automated dependency updates with compatibility checking
- Accessibility review for WCAG compliance
- Performance profiling with bottleneck identification
- Command and agent scaffolding generators
- Data scientist agent for ML/data analysis
- DevOps troubleshooter for infrastructure issues
- Performance engineer for optimization
- Project task planner for work breakdown

7. KIT 6 - WEB UI & STREAMING
Features to integrate:
- Web-based dashboard UI (port 7000)
- Streaming context injection hooks
- Auto PR reviewer agent
- Model switching capabilities
- Live command and agent browsing
- Real-time analytics visualization

DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT:
- Node.js and npm for JavaScript tooling
- Bun runtime for TypeScript hook execution
- Python 3.11+ with packages: better-sqlite3, flask, mkdocs, mkdocs-material
- Git for version control integration
- GitHub CLI for PR operations

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Verify all commands execute without errors
- Test hook registration and execution order
- Validate memory persistence across sessions
- Ensure dashboard accessibility on configured ports
- Test CI/CD pipeline triggers

- Validate all agent responses

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
- Sanitize all user inputs in commands
- Secure storage of memory databases
- API key protection for model configurations
- Safe file system operations with path validation
- Prevent command injection in shell operations
- Secure web dashboard with appropriate headers

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Dashboard response time < 500ms
- Memory operations < 100ms
- Command execution < 2s for most operations
- Support for projects with 10,000+ files
- Efficient memory usage < 500MB baseline
- Concurrent operation support
