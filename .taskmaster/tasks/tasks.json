        "details": "This task involves systematically testing all original CCDK commands to verify they continue to function as expected after the enhancement kits integration. The tester should:\n\n1. Create a comprehensive list of all original CCDK commands and their expected behaviors\n2. Test each command with various parameter combinations:\n   - Required parameters\n   - Optional parameters\n   - Edge cases (empty values, maximum values, special characters, unicode characters)\n   - Invalid parameters to verify error handling\n   - Extremely long inputs and file paths\n\n3. For each command, verify:\n   - Command executes without errors\n   - Output matches expected format and content\n   - Performance is comparable to pre-integration baseline\n   - Help documentation is accurate and accessible\n   - Behavior with different user permissions\n   - Behavior when chained with other commands\n   - Behavior during concurrent execution\n\n4. Document any deviations from expected behavior with:\n   - Command and parameters used\n   - Expected vs. actual output\n   - Error messages if applicable\n   - Environment details (OS, configuration)\n\n5. Create regression test scripts that can be automated for future testing\n\nKey commands to test include but are not limited to:\n- Help commands and all their variations\n- Project initialization commands\n- Configuration commands\n- Build and compilation commands\n- Deployment commands\n- Status and information commands\n- File operation commands (create, read, write, edit, delete)\n- Search functionality with regex patterns\n- Code generation commands for different languages\n- Git operation commands\n- Command chaining operations\n\nThe testing should be performed in a clean environment that matches the target deployment configuration to ensure accurate results.",

Create a test matrix listing all CCDK commands with columns for:\n   - Command name\n   - Parameters tested\n   - Expected result\n   - Actual result\n   - Pass/Fail status\n\n2. Set up multiple test environments representing different user configurations:\n   - Fresh installation\n   - Upgrade from previous version\n   - Various operating systems\n   - Different user permission levels\n\n3. Execute each command following these steps:\n   - Run with default parameters and verify output\n   - Run with each optional parameter and verify behavior changes appropriately\n   - Run with invalid inputs to verify error handling\n   - Run with malformed inputs to test error recovery\n   - Run with extremely long file paths to test path handling\n   - Run with unicode characters to test internationalization\n   - Run in different project contexts (empty project, complex project)\n   - Run concurrently with other commands to test isolation\n   - Run in command chains to test integration\n\n4. Compare command output against documented specifications\n\n5. Measure and record performance metrics:\n   - Execution time\n   - Resource usage (memory limits testing)\n   - Compare to baseline measurements from pre-integration version\n\n6. Automate test cases using shell scripts or testing frameworks\n\n7. Document all test results with screenshots and command logs\n\n8. Create a summary report highlighting:\n   - Total commands tested\n   - Pass/fail statistics\n   - Any performance regressions\n   - Recommendations for fixes if issues are found\n\nThe test is considered successful when all commands function according to their original specifications with no regressions in functionality or performance.",

        "details": "This task involves creating a hook system that allows enhancement kits to integrate with the original CCDK command execution flow. Implementation details include:\n\n1. Identify all command execution points in the original CCDK codebase where hooks should be inserted:\n   - Command parsing phase\n   - Pre-execution phase\n   - Post-execution phase\n   - Error handling phase\n\n2. Design a hook architecture that:\n   - Minimizes performance impact on original commands\n   - Provides consistent interface for enhancement kits\n   - Maintains backward compatibility\n   - Allows multiple hooks to be registered at each trigger point\n\n3. Implement the hook trigger mechanism:\n   ```\n   // Example hook implementation\n   class CommandHookManager {\n     private static hooks = {\n       pre: new Map(),\n       post: new Map(),\n       error: new Map()\n     };\n     \n     static registerHook(phase, commandName, callback) {\n       if (!this.hooks[phase].has(commandName)) {\n         this.hooks[phase].set(commandName, []);\n       }\n       this.hooks[phase].get(commandName).push(callback);\n     }\n     \n     static triggerHooks(phase, commandName, context) {\n       const commandHooks = this.hooks[phase].get(commandName) || [];\n       const globalHooks = this.hooks[phase].get('*') || [];\n       \n       return [...commandHooks, ...globalHooks].reduce(\n         (ctx, hook) => hook(ctx), \n         context\n       );\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. Modify the original command execution flow to trigger hooks at appropriate points:\n   - Before command execution to allow parameter modification\n   - After successful execution to allow result transformation\n   - During error scenarios to allow custom error handling\n\n5. Create documentation for enhancement kit developers on:\n   - Available hook points\n   - Hook registration process\n   - Context object structure\n   - Best practices for hook implementation\n\n6. Implement logging for hook execution to aid in debugging and performance monitoring.",

Performance testing:\n   - Measure execution time of commands with and without hooks\n   - Establish performance benchmarks for hook execution\n   - Test with multiple hooks to ensure scalability\n\n4. Create a test enhancement kit that:\n   - Registers hooks for all major CCDK commands\n   - Logs hook activation for verification\n   - Modifies command behavior in predictable ways for testing\n\n5. Manual verification:\n   - Execute each original CCDK command and verify hooks trigger\n   - Check that hook context contains all necessary information\n   - Verify that hook modifications to command behavior work as expected\n\n6.
