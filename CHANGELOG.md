## Upgrading from v1.0.0 to v2.0.0

The hooks system is optional but recommended for enhanced security and developer experience.

### To add hooks to your existing v1.0.0 project:

1. **Copy the hooks directory to your project**:
   ```bash
   cp -r hooks your-project/.claude/hooks/
   ```

2. **Configure hooks in your project**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the settings template to your project
   cp hooks/setup/settings.json.template your-project/.claude/settings.json
   
   # Edit to update the WORKSPACE path
   # All hooks including subagent-context-injector are pre-configured
   ```

3. **Test the installation**:
   ```bash
   # Run the hook setup verification
   /hook-setup
   ```

4. **Update existing command files** (optional):
   - Commands will work without changes, but you can simplify sub-agent prompts
   - Remove manual `Read /CLAUDE.md` instructions from Task prompts
   - Sub-agents now automatically receive core documentation
